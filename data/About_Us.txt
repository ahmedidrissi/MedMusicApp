Hey! I'm IDRISSI Ahmed a student engineer at ENSIAS Rabat.

I made this music player application using Python and KivyMD. It allows you to add albums from your phone storage, create your own playlists, play music and convert YouTube music to mp3 format.

You can find the source code in my GitHub account. Enjoy it!
